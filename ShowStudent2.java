/*Create a constructor for the Student class you created. The constructor should initialize each Studentâ€™s ID number to 9999, his or her points earned to 12, and
credit hours to 3 (resulting in a grade point average of 4.0). Write a program that demonstrates that the constructor works by instantiating an object and
displaying the initial values. Save the application as ShowStudent2.java.*/
